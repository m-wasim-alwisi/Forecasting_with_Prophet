# README: Time Series Forecasting with Prophet

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that guides you through **time series forecasting** using **Prophet**, an open-source tool developed by Facebook's Core Data Science team.

This tutorial is written in **Python**.

-----

## üöÄ Key Features

The notebook demonstrates how to use the Prophet library, which is ideal for data with strong seasonal effects and historical data.

This project covers the following steps:

  * **Introduction to Prophet:** Learn what Prophet is and its decomposition model (trend, seasonality, and holiday effects).
  * **Setup and Data Cleaning:** Prepare the time series data for Prophet, including renaming columns to the required `ds` (datestamp) and `y` (metric) format.
  * **Forecasting:** Generate future predictions.
  * **Model Tuning:** Explore how to add custom **changepoints** and adjust the trend of the forecast.

Prophet offers forecasts that are generally **accurate and fast**, and it is **robust to missing data and outliers**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

The required libraries can be installed using `pip`:

```python
%pip install plotly
%pip install prophet
```

The notebook uses standard Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

## üìÅ File Structure

  * `Time_Series_Forecasting_with_Prophet.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the tutorial and code.
  * The project uses the **Air Passengers dataset**.
